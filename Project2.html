            <p><br>Citizens are in dire need of a more interactive and fun way to contribute towards the
                betterment of the environment, as the current methods make the problem seem
                
                farfetched and difficult to solve.
                <br><br>Our motivation is derived from the stimuli that many people all over the world want to contribute towards the
                amelioration of the environment but either find it hard to know where to start or assume that the problem is
                unachievable from their end. On the other end of the spectrum, many people have not thought about environmental
                welfare as they are not prompted properly to do so. The lack of a platform which would educate and indulge people in

                willfully participating in this activity for the greater good is what fueled us further to go for this project.
                <br><br>The BETTER WORLD NOW initiative aims to unite like-minded people for the noble cause of doing our small yet utmost
                duty towards helping the environment and, in turn, saving humankind in the long run. We want to provide a one-stop
                solution platform to educate people about environmental welfare and give more significant insights into how their small
                part has positively impacted the earth on a grander scale. It would give users more significant incentives like monetary
                aid and self-development boost to further help the cause. The initiative will provide users with a friendly rating system

                for becoming a responsible and good samaritans.
