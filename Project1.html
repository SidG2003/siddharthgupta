            <h1>Hyper personalised 3D <br>Lamp Model.</h1>
            <p><br>In today’s time, most homes have become closed and there’s a dissociation between the
                outside and the inside. I am more fond of older homes, as they never make you feel trapped.
                The lamp that I’ve made takes a step towards bridging this gap between the insides of our
                    homes and the natural world outside along with adding to the aesthetics of the interior. Thus
                it fulfils this requirement.
                <br><br>
                The lamp takes inspiration from the structure of trees, but also does not fully simulate it in
                order to make it look like a designed product and not just a tree model. To fulfil the same
                purpose of keeping it surreal, the colours used are not conventional tree colours, neither are
                the leaves.
